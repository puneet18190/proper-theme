                        <p>Stephen bought his first buy to let property in 1992, and has gradually expanded this portfolio over the past 20+ years.  Acquiring property was initially a side venture, with focus being on the long term investment benefits. It was only in 2007 that it has become Stephen's full time occupation. Since then the portfolio has rapidly expanded, with further growth planned for the near future. Emma has increasingly become more active in the management of these properties since completing her degree in International Relations in 2014. June 2014 cemented this relationship and marked the formation of SEAL Partnership Limited, with both Emma and Stephen being company directors. June 2015 has seen the opening of the first high street branch of SEAL Properties and the future is expected to bring yet more growth to the business as the partnership develops.</p>
